# Research Task

### Problems Martian business may face in 2120:

1. Oxygen supply.
2. Food and vegetables supply
3. Space suit supply
4. Marketing.
5. Banking 
6. Recreation space and parks
7. Living space for people coming from earth
8. Treatment or Medical needs
9. Another Big Pandemic


### Possible Solutions:

#### 1. Oxygen supply.
#### Possible solution: 
This would be the biggest issue in 2120 on Mars. There would be regular space shuttle from mars to earth to bring
more oxygen supplies. Greenhouse farming can be another solution to produce oxygen and supply them to the people.

#### 2. Food and vegetables supply
#### Possible solution:
Greenhouse farming can be establish to grow vegetables. For other food items, still have to depend on the earth.

#### 3. Space suit supply:
#### Possible solution:
Space suit would be the most necessary things if any Martian wants to go out or move any places. So supply of space suit should be good. A small factory
can be set up in Mars for this purpose.

#### 4. Marketing:
#### Possible solution:
Marketing would be done through online events and advertisements so that people living on mars get them online.

#### 5. Banking:
#### Possible solution:
Banking and any kind of transactions would be based on cryptocurrency. So no physical bank or money will be needed. Every transaction
would be online only and encrypted. Billie will be really helpful for the people.

#### 6. Recreation space and parks:
#### Possible solution:
As oxygen supplies would be on demand, so recreation space and parks would not be a reality. People would have small tours of Mars
wearing space suit and travelling through space cars.

#### 7. Living space for people coming from earth:
#### Possible solution:
There will be houses and hotels but new people coming from earth will face accommodation problem as building new houses would not be easier. 
So living in the already build hotels would be the solution for the time being. 

#### 8. Treatment or Medical needs
#### Possible solution:
If someone gets sick, it will be really tough to do the treatment in a oxygen less environment. A complete setup (rooms with oxygen supply and medical items)can be done for small treatments and
surgery's. 

#### 9. Another Big Pandemic:
#### Possible solution:
Another big pandemic supposed to happen in 2120 on the earth. There is a possibility that Martians will also get infected. So proper pandemic prevention
and management need to be planned ahead from the beginning of the living on Mars. There should be special teams and setups ready for addressing the needs who are infected.
